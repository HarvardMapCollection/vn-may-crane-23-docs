# All scripts

`all-jsons.py` retrieves all data fields from the metadata .json files and makes one master pandas dataframe and exports it as all-metadata.csv 
`all-jsons.py` was adapted from Belle Lipton's [get-jsons.py](https://github.com/HarvardMapCollection/hgl-explr/blob/main/scripts/get-jsons.py), which retrieved select data fields from the metadata .json files.

# Documentation instructions
With each big step, explain the why of functions and decisions. Ensure anyone interested in replication/learning can understand and do. Can be a list. Link files to scripts.
